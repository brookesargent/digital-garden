hi, i'm brooke 👋 

i am a technologist, engineering manager, and chronic overthinker. this space is my outlet for... all of that; a digital garden where i tend to ideas at various stages of growth.

i write about what i'm learning and noticing in the world with topics typically orbiting around technology, engineering management, and my hobbies.

when i'm not learning and building, you can usually find me baking sourdough or cookies, reading a horror novel, or growing a few too many varieties of tomato.

This is my digital garden — a place where I tend to ideas at different stages of growth. Some notes are seedlings, freshly planted and still forming. Others have had time to develop and branch out.

I write about what I'm reading, thinking, and noticing. Topics tend to orbit around gender, media criticism, engineering management, writing, and whatever else catches my attention.

This isn't a blog with a publishing schedule. It's a garden — things grow at their own pace.

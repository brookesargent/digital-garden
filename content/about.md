hi, i'm brooke 👋 

i am a technologist, engineering manager, and chronic overthinker. this space is my outlet for... all of that; a digital garden where i tend to ideas at various stages of growth.

i write about what i'm learning and noticing in the world with topics typically orbiting around technology, engineering management, and my hobbies.

hobbies include: baking & cooking, reading, growing a vegetable & herb garden, researching and learning about new topics.
